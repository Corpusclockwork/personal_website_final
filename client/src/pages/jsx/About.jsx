                Hello :D 
                <br />
                This is my personal website. My name is Lamis (see url :P), my prounous are she/her. I've been drawing for
                years and wanted a page that wasn't my personal Instagram to give out to people if they asked about it.
                Some of the art is from when I was younger and worse at making art, but I've included it anyway. Seeing progress
                is always nice :). 
                I've also added a code section for personal programming projects, as it's probably good to showcase skills that actually pay :)))). 
                <br />
                <br />
                I built this website using React for the frontend, and NodeJS with Express in the backend to serve the images and animations.
                <br />
                <br />
                Have a nice day !
